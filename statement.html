  	For my project one, I have decided to emulate the experience of a zoo. The experience of visiting a zoo in real life is quite fascinating; in zoos, you are able to see exotic creatures and animals from all over the planet that you would have never been able to see otherwise. Watching animals exhibit their typical daily behaviors in their natural habitats makes for an entertaining and wholesome viewing experience, and this is the experience that I wanted to capture in my website. I sought to create quirky GIFs of animals in their natural habitats to intrigue the user in the same way watching animals at a zoo would intrigue someone. My project one functions more so as a video game than a website in this regard; video games are essentially emulations of real life, so I thought it would be appropriate to draw heavy inspiration from video games for my project.
